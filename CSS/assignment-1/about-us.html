        <article>
          <p>
            What does 'great coffee' mean to you? For us at Souvenir, great
            coffee means three things: community, quality, and care. We craft
            premium, small batch roasted coffee for people who enjoy taking a
            moment with a cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focus exclusively on the best brewed coffee for the everyday
            coffee drinker, and proudly provide a conscientious, low-waste and
            green product. All of us here promote social and community
            involvement through support of local art and music and media.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see community as an eagerness to engage those around us, and to
            make positive change in the lives of those with whom we come into
            contact. Many of us have met new opportunities, our friends, and
            even partners through coffee, and we look forward to getting to know
            you too. Our motto at Souvenir is
            <em>People first, then coffee.</em>
